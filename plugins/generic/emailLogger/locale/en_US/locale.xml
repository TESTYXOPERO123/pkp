On top of being enabled, you need to setup an environment variable called PKP_EMAIL_LOGGER_ON and set it's value to 1 in order to make this plugin working. Once working, you can retrieve all emails using the EmailLogDAO and the event type EMAIL_LOGGER_PLUGIN_ANY_EVENT. The main purpose of this plugin is to help functional tests to check whether or not the system sent an email.</message>
